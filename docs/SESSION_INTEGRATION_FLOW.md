# Session Integration Flow

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document explains how the different components of CodeState work together to create a seamless session management experience. Think of it as a conductor coordinating an orchestra - each component has its role, but they work together to create the complete experience.

## 🔄 **How Components Work Together**

### **1. Save Session Flow**

When you save a session, here's what happens:

**Git Integration:**
- First, the system checks if you're in a Git repository
- If you have uncommitted changes, it asks: "What do you want to do with these changes?"
- You can choose to commit them, stash them, or cancel
- The system captures your current Git state: which branch you're on, which commit, and if there are any stashed changes

**File State Capture:**
- In CLI mode: The `files` array is empty (no file positions captured)
- In VSCode: The extension would capture which files are open, cursor positions, scroll positions

**Session Creation:**
- All this data (Git state + file state + your notes/tags) gets bundled into a session object
- The session gets saved to disk with a unique ID

### **2. Resume Session Flow**

When you resume a session, here's the orchestration:

**Current State Check:**
- The system looks at your current Git repository
- If you have uncommitted work, it asks: "Do you want to save your current work first?"
- This prevents you from losing work when switching sessions

**Git State Restoration:**
- Switches to the branch that was saved in the session
- If there were stashed changes, it applies those stashes back
- This puts your Git repository exactly as it was when you saved

**Script Execution:**
- Looks up all scripts that were saved for this project root
- Opens terminal windows and runs each script
- This restores your development environment (servers, watchers, etc.)

**IDE & File Opening:**
- Opens your configured IDE (VS Code, etc.) with the project
- If the session had files open, it opens those files at the exact positions
- In CLI mode, this part is skipped

### **3. Update Session Flow**

When you update a session:

**Same as Save, but Different:**
- Loads the existing session first
- Captures current Git state (same logic as save)
- Captures current file state
- Updates the session with new data but keeps the same ID and name
- This is like "overwriting" your save game with the current state

## 🎯 **Key Integration Points**

### **Git ↔ Session**
- Sessions capture Git state when saving
- Sessions restore Git state when resuming
- Git dirty state handling prevents data loss

### **Terminal ↔ Session**
- Sessions store which scripts should run for a project
- When resuming, terminals automatically execute those scripts
- This restores your development environment

### **IDE ↔ Session**
- Sessions store which files were open and where
- When resuming, IDE opens those files at exact positions
- This restores your exact working context

### **File System ↔ Session**
- Sessions are stored as JSON files on disk
- An index file keeps track of all sessions for fast listing
- Atomic operations prevent corruption

## 🔧 **The Orchestration**

Think of it like a **conductor coordinating an orchestra**:

1. **Git** provides the "musical score" (repository state)
2. **Terminal** provides the "instruments" (running processes)
3. **IDE** provides the "sheet music" (open files and positions)
4. **Session** is the "conductor" that remembers how everything was set up
5. **File System** is the "recording studio" where everything gets saved

When you save, the conductor records the current state of everything.
When you resume, the conductor tells everyone to get back to their exact positions.

The beauty is that each component (Git, Terminal, IDE) doesn't need to know about sessions - they just do their normal jobs. The session system coordinates them all together.
