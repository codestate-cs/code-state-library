## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
2. Run CLI: `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`
3. Build: `pnpm build`

## Scripts

- `dev` - Start CLI in dev mode
- `build` - Build both CLI and types packages
- `build:cli` - Build CLI package only
- `build:types` - Build types package only
- `test` - Run all tests

## Build System

This project uses a dual-package build system that creates:
1. **Core Package** (`codestate-core`) - Domain models, use cases, and services
2. **CLI Package** (`codestate-cli`) - Main CLI executable with comprehensive command support

Both packages are published to npm and can be used independently or together.

See [BUILD_SYSTEM.md](./BUILD_SYSTEM.md) for detailed documentation.
